*Do you approve the budget?**

In order to approve or disapprove the budget, we need a quorum of resident owners to vote. That means even if you approve (or disapprove), you need to cast a ballot!

Voting remains open until midnight on December 20th. Should a quorum not be achieved by this deadline, voting will extend until it is reached.
